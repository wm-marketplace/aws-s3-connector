## Connector  Introduction
Connector is a Java based backend extension for WaveMaker applications. Connectors are built as Java modules & exposes java based SDK to interact with the connector implementation.
Each connector is built for a specific purpose and can be integrated with one of the external services. Connectors are imported & used in the WaveMaker application. Each connector runs on its own container thereby providing the ability to have itâ€™s own version of the third party dependencies.
## Features of Connectors
1. Connector is a java based extension which can be integrated with external services and reused in many Wavemaker applications.
1. Each connector can work as an SDK for an external system.
1. Connectors can be imported once in a WaveMaker application and used many times in the applications by creating multiple instances.
1. Connectors are executed in its own container in the WaveMaker application, as a result there are no dependency version conflict issues between connectors.
## About AWS S3 Connector
## Introduction
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable, high-speed, low-cost web-based service designed for online backup and archiving of data and application programs.

The subscriber has control over the accessibility of data, i.e. privately/publicly accessible.
This connector exposes api to interact with AWS S3 from WaveMaker application.
## Prerequisite

1. Internet connection
## Build
You can build this connector using following command
```
mvn clean install
```

## Deploy
You can import connector dist/aws-s3-connector.zip artifact in WaveMaker studio application using file upload option.On after uploading into wavemaker, you can update your profile properties such as AWS key and Secret.


## Use S3 connector in WaveMaker
```
@Autowired
private S3Connector s3Connector;
List<WMS3ObjectSummary> wms3ObjectSummaries = s3Connector.listS3Objects();
s3Connector.downloadFile("IMG_20200202_115106.jpg");
```
Apart from above apis, there are other apis exposed in this connector, please vist connector interface in the api module.
